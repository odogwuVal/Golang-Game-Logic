# Lucky Number Game 🍀

## Overview
A simple game where you guess a random number generated by the program. You have 5 attempts to guess the correct number. The higher your guess, the harder it gets!

## How to Run
1. **Build the Program**:
   ```bash
   go build -o lucky_number_game
   ```

2. **Run the Game**:
    ```bash
    ./lucky_number_game <your_guess>
    ```

## Example
```bash
./lucky_number_game 10
```

### Game Logic:
The program picks 5 random numbers between 0 and your guess.
If your guess matches any of the random numbers, you win.
If not, you lose after 5 attempts.
